🎨 Virtual Painter - Hand Gesture Based Painting App
Overview
The Virtual Painter is an interactive application that uses hand gestures for real-time painting on the screen, created using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The tool tracks hand movements to allow users to draw, select colors, and adjust brush sizes, all without any physical input devices!

Features
🖐 Hand Tracking: Leveraging MediaPipe to detect hand gestures and finger positions, enabling intuitive control over the drawing process.
🖌 Virtual Drawing: Draw directly on the screen based on hand movements, with smooth real-time tracking.
🌈 Color and Brush Size Selection: Change brush colors and sizes with simple hand gestures.
🚀 Easy to Use: No external hardware required—just a camera and your hands!

How It Works
Hand Detection: MediaPipe’s hand tracking is used to detect hand landmarks and track specific finger tips to identify drawing gestures.
Drawing: OpenCV enables drawing on a canvas based on the hand's movement.
Gesture Controls:
Index Finger: Drawing
Thumb and Index Together: Change colors and brush sizes
